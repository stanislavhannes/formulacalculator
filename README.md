#Formula calculator

On Javascript based calculator that can calculate with self-defined variables. The variables can be defined with a set of numbers.

For example *a + b; 1 <= a < 3; 4 <= b < 7* will reveal:

* *a+b = 5 [ a = 1 b = 4 ]*
* *a+b = 6 [ a = 1 b = 5 ]*
* *a+b = 7 [ a = 1 b = 6 ]*
* *a+b = 6 [ a = 2 b = 4 ]*
* *a+b = 7 [ a = 2 b = 5 ]*
* *a+b = 8 [ a = 2 b = 6 ]*
